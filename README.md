# GovBlocks
GovBlocks is a multi-factorial governance framework for blockchain applications. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Requirements
```
Node >= 7.6
```


### Installing
Firstly, you need to clone this repo. You can do so by downloading the repo as a zip and unpacking or using the following git command

```
git clone https://github.com/somish/govblocks-protocol.git
```

Now, It's time to install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```
We need to compile the contracts before deploying. We'll be using truffle for that (You can use Remix or solc directly).
```
truffle compile
```
Now, You should start a private network on port 7545 using Ganache or something similar. Then, you can deploy your GovBlocks dApp using the migrate script.
```
truffle deploy
```
You can use public networks as well but you will first have to do the initialization manually as the contracts will pick up the official addresses otherwise. We recommend using the GovBlocks UI if you wish to test on a public network.


## Modularity
GovBlocks is built on the Ethereum blockchain and it uses a modular system for grouping of Ethereum smart contracts, allowing logical components of the system to be upgraded without affecting the other components. Following are the key modules of GovBlocks.


### Master
Master module of every contract is used to bind all the modules together. It contains addresses of all other contracts and updates them when a new version is added.
Contract:
* [Master.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) addNewVersion : It is used to add new version of all the contracts.
3) configureGlobalParameters : It is used to configure global parameters


### Governance
Governance is used for doing the core governance like submitting proposals.
Contracts:
* [Governance.sol]
* [GovernanceData.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) createProposal : It is used to submit new proposal.
2) createProposalwithSolution : It is used to submit new proposal with a solution.
3) calculateMemberReward : It is used to calculate the reward to be deistributed once the proposal is closed.


### MemberRoles
MemberRoles module of manages all the member roles. Every member role can have different authorizations. It is an independent module and can be used by other dApps to implement feature rich Member Roles!
Contract:
* [MemberRoles.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) addNewMemberRole : It is used to add new member role.
2) getAllAddressByRoleId : It returns all member address that have a particular role


### Pool
Pool of every dApp holds the Ethereum and GBT for distributing the default incentive upon acceptance of a proposal. It is also used to call oraclize to close proposal when the time is over.
Contract:
* [Pool.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) buyPoolGBT : It is used to buy GBT using Ethereum.
2) claimReward : It is used to claim reward earned by participating on the platform. 


### ProposalCategory
ProposalCategory module is used to manage the proposal categories and sub categories. It contains all the category and sub category data. It is an independent module and can be used by other dApps to implement feature rich category and sub categories!
Contract:
* [ProposalCategory.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) addNewCategory : It is used to add a new category.
2) updateCategory : It updates an exisitng category.
3) addNewSubCategory : It is used to add a new sub category under an existing category.
4) updateSubCategory : It is used to edit an exisitng sub category.


### SimpleVoting
SimpleVoting is a simple VotingType which works when only one solution can be selected for voting. It also helps distribute reward when a proposal is closed. Multiple Voting Types are in works, stay tuned!
Contract:
* [SimpleVoting.sol]

Some important functions : 
1) addSolution : It is used to add a solution to a proposal.
2) proposalVoting : It is used for casting votes.
3) closeProposalVote : It moves voting to next phase (if next phase is available)
4) giveRewardAfterFinalDecision : It sets the reward to be distributed. Users can claim these rewards once the proposal is closed.
